  <meta name="description" content="The Gujarati Hindu community is very close knit and is based on very traditional family values, the ability to communicate in the Gujarati language is important to be able to integrate into the British society. As many parents live apart from their British born children it becomes more difficult for them to communicate and create a full and integrated life for themselves. As such, much of the older community remain in close proximity to each other to ensure all members have the companionship and support they need.">

      <h2>Ambition</h2>
      <p>We Would Like To Commission A Purpose Built Venue For Future Activity. The Premises Would Be Home To The SSDC 50 Plus Charity, But Would Also Be Available For Members To Hire For Their Own Family Events. From The Income Received From Venue Hire We Would Be Able Increase The Number Of Members And Open Our Doors To Younger Members Of The Community Who May Wish To Be Involved. It Would Also Reduce The Number Of Grants We Apply For To Allow The Charity To Continue. We Are Currently Looking For Investors And Charitable Donations To Assist In This Process. </p>
