  <meta name="description" content="The Gujarati Hindu community is very close knit and is based on very traditional family values, the ability to communicate in the Gujarati language is important to be able to integrate into the British society. As many parents live apart from their British born children it becomes more difficult for them to communicate and create a full and integrated life for themselves. As such, much of the older community remain in close proximity to each other to ensure all members have the companionship and support they need.">

    <h2>Our Activities</h2>
    <p class="long-p">

      We run more than 22-day centre sessions per year where members have to pay £2 per head for breakfast and afternoon lunch. Different activities like Yoga for elderly. We arrange specialists to come to day centre i.e. person from national pension services, solicitors to help with legal advice, dietician for diet requirement who would inform about calories in Guajarati food, diabetes, arthritis and heart problem which is very common with our people etc.
      We have evening function with live Indian band who come from India

    <p class="long-p">
      As we do not have our property, we hire hall for day centre and evening function due to this we have to limit our membership to about 350. Day centre attendance is on average 100 members and evening function is 250 members. At our evening function, members do not have to pay any extra as we also serve them hot full Gujarati meal.
      We have fundraised for International Disasters, And for Other Charities like Hart Foundation ECT. 
      We have also provided our volunteers to other communities to help them. Our charity is based on annual membership fee; nominal charge is applied to attend our day centre activities.
      We raise funds from our members and our community friends to provide and improve quality of life of our members and community.
      This year we have donated £2000 to help with corona virus with facemasks to hospitals and some cash donation as well.
