  <meta name="description" content="The Gujarati Hindu community is very close knit and is based on very traditional family values, the ability to communicate in the Gujarati language is important to be able to integrate into the British society. As many parents live apart from their British born children it becomes more difficult for them to communicate and create a full and integrated life for themselves. As such, much of the older community remain in close proximity to each other to ensure all members have the companionship and support they need.">
